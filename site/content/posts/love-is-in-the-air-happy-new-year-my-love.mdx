### What does it mean to be in love?

The love of a lifetime is something that can be felt from the moment you meet your partner until the day you die. True love is a feeling that fills your heart with happiness and makes every day worth living. It's a feeling that you can't just explain, you have to experience it for yourself. When two people are in love, they're always happy and their relationship is unlike any other. They're able to share secrets and feel comfortable around each other even when there's screaming and yelling. Falling in love is an amazing experience and it's something that should be cherished forever.

### What are the benefits of being in a loving relationship?

1. Love is in the air this year! Whether you're single or coupled up, there's something special about this time of year. Let's enjoy every moment and make 2018 our best year yet!
2. New Year's resolutions are a great way to start off the new year, but don't forget to keep your love life in mind! Make sure you're spending enough time with your partner and taking advantage of all the opportunities that come your way.
3. Feeling single? Don't feel bad about it! There's nothing wrong with wanting to be in a relationship. If you're feeling a little lonely, don't be afraid to reach out to someone and start dating again. We all need love and companionship from time to time!
4. Remember to keep your goals in mind throughout the year. You may want to extend your career or take on a new hobby, but remember that you should also make time for yourself.
5. How do you plan on spending the holidays? With family, friends, and/or alone?
